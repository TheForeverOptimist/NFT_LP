          If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a great
          way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic value or even
          exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT bandwagon and spending
          eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. Our advice: spend the
          weekend <a class="nftLink" href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by this time next week,
          you'll be a millionaire.

        <p>
          Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk
          (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a
          total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS Code
          screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text on a
          black background is the actual NFT we're selling.

          Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're
          selling them, not buying them.
